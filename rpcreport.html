		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
<li class="a"> Yes and yes.</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>__X__ Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
The protocol is a simple one. A function call or return is represented by a
string, which contains the function name, optionally followed by the return
value or the arguments, encoded as a base 64 string.

We converted strings to base 64 using code found online, with Noah's permission
(see base64.cpp). Arrays, structs, and arguments for function calls were
converted by converting each value to a base 64 string, and concatenating them,
using spaces as delimiters (base 64 strings do not contain spaces). Values were
ordered by index (arrays), field name (structs), or natural order (arguments).
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
The TAs helped us debug an error with passing arrays by reference. We were
passing a pointer to an array, which the C++ compiler was rejecting because of
the way we were declaring the function.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
We felt that the assignment was definitely worthwhile. In the previous
assignment, dealing with high levels of file nastiness felt unrealistic
because of the absurdly high disk failure rate. This assignment however
did not have any challenges that seemed to be 'artificially' created and
the difficulty/learning lay with system design.
</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="reportbody">ADDITIONAL iNFORMATION</h2>

<p>We decided on this protocol because it makes serialization dead simple. We
just encode everything recursively, and leave memory management to C++ strings.
It does the same for deserialization; since we can pass all arguments as a
string, parsing is contained to the relevant stub function, and we never need to
allocate memory on the heap. Even better, spaces are the delimiters used by C++
stringstreams, so it was easy to store and retrieve values incrementally. Using
strings everywhere gives our (remote and local) function calls similar type
signatures, resulting in clean generated code. And while base 64 strings aren't
human-readable, they print nicely in the terminal or log files, and can be
decoded in other tools or compared manually.<p>
